## Introduction
If you're familiar with Magento and you've spent some time working with CMS pages and static blocks, you'll know that producing clean semantic HTML markup with the TinyMCE editor can be quite a hassle. Especially when fiddling around in the "design view" it'll often result in invalid or unwanted HTML. Of course you can open up the default source editor and go from there. But you probably know that this will not be very pleasant as well, the code looks like a big bowl of tag soup and editing it can give you a real headache.

This extension adds an additional editor to Magento's WYSIWYG editor that is similar to your favorite IDE. It offers several great <a href="#Features">features</a> that will not only save you quite a bit of time but also makes editing HTML a lot easier.

###CodeMirror
Under the hood this extension uses <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> and a handful of it's addons. In case you never heard of CodeMirror, let us quote the author of this great library real quick:

<em>"CodeMirror is a versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser. It is specialized for editing code, and comes with a number of language modes and addons that implement more advanced editing functionality."</em>

##Features
The following features are available can be enabled or disabled via System > Configuration.

* Fully customizable appearance
* Code formatting

##Getting started
Aside from installing the extension through <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/advanced-html-editor.html">Magento Connect</a> you can do this manually as well.

1. Download the extension
2. Copy / paste the contents in your Magento root directory
3. Log out of the admin panel and remove all cache files

##Browser support

##Credits
We really must give credit to Marijn Haverbeke (of <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> fame) and of course all it's contributors. Because let's be honest, all we did was wrap the library up in a TinyMCE plugin and make it customizable through the Magento admin ;).
